ASSIGNMENT 8

I was unable to complete the assignment because I was experiencing issues with podman. 
At first, I managed to build a podman image successfully, however it wouln't run. I received help from Sally and
Aakanksha during our last class, where we deleted the podman image, rebuilt it and still no luck. Then I tried by 
doing the prerequisites because I thought that it was only for mac's with the M chip and mine's intel, but still no luck. 
With Aakanksha, we tried deleting podman, to get the updated podman 5 but my computer kept redowloading podman 4.9, therefore
the podman build was still not working. During the week, I tried to delete podman and redownload it yet it still redownloaded 
the wrong version. I was advised to update my laptop but I currently have no space to do so. 

Thank you,
